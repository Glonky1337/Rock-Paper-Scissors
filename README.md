## What I learned

### HTML:
- Semantic HTML: The HTML code uses semantic tags to describe the content of the website, such as "header", "section", "main", and "footer".
- Responsive design: The website is designed to be responsive using the "viewport" meta tag, which ensures that the website adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

### CSS:
- Flexbox layout: The layout of the website is created using the "display: flex" property, which allows for a flexible and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Box model: The layout of individual elements on the page is determined by the CSS box model, which includes properties like "padding", "border", and "margin".
- CSS animation: The CSS code uses keyframe animations to create an animated effect when the user hovers over the game buttons.

### JavaScript:
- DOM manipulation: The JavaScript code uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate the elements on the page in response to user interaction.
- Event listeners: The JavaScript code adds event listeners to the game buttons to detect when the user clicks on a button and initiate the game logic.
- Random number generation: The JavaScript code uses the Math.random() function to generate a random number for the computer's move in the game.
